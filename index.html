        ‍
        
    <h3>    Automatic collection of information</h3>
        
        Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no-logs policy. We may process only minimal
        user data, only as much as it is cessary to maintain the Software Applications and Services. Information collected
        automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the
        usage of the Software Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way
        that would identify any particular user of the system.
        
        ‍
        
    <h3> Collection of personal information</h3>
        
        You can access and use the Software Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information
        by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
        features in the Software Applications, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name
        and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, make a
        purchase, or fill any online forms in the Software Applications. When required, this information may include the
        following:
        
        - Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
        - Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
        - Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.
        - Payment information such as credit card details, bank details, etc.
        - Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.
        - Certain features on the mobile device such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc.
        
        Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Software Applications and Services. However, we may also
        collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party
        data providers, and our joint marketing partners. Personal Information we collect from other sources may include
        demographic information, such as age and gender, device information, such as IP addresses, location, such as city and
        state, and online behavioural data, such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information
        and search results and links. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be
        able to take advantage of some of the features in the Software Applications. Users who are uncertain about what
        information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
        
        ‍
        
    <h3> Use and processing of collected information</h3>
        
        In order to make the Software Applications and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to
        collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able
        to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the
        following purposes:
        
        - Create and manage user accounts
        - Deliver products or services

        - Send administrative information
        - Respond to inquiries and offer support
        - Request user feedback
        - Improve user experience
        - Enforce terms and conditions and policies
        - Protect from abuse and malicious users
        - Respond to legal requests and prevent harm
        - Run and operate the Software Applications and Services
        
        Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Software Application and Services, where you
        are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific
        purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California
        Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of
        an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance
        with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
        interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the
        legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
        
        Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by
        opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be
        happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
        Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        
        ‍
        
    <h3> Billing and payments</h3>
        
        We use third-party payment processors to assist us in processing your payment information securely. Such third-party
        processors' use of your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not
        contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.
        
        ‍
        
        
        ‍
        
    <h3>   Disclosure of information</h3>
        
        Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have
        requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other
        affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Software Applications and Services available
        to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized
        to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal
        requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies
        are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties
        are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize
        them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
        
        We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply
        with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our
        rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
        
        In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or
        a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.
        
        ‍
    <h3>  Managing information</h3>
        
        You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may
        change as the Mobile Application and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a
        copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to
        our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information
        or permanently delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.
        
    <h3>    Retention of information</h3>
        
        We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
        disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any
        aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a
        manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted.
        Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability
        cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
        
        ‍
        
    <h3>   Transfer of information</h3>
        
        Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than
        your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European
        Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such
        as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place,
        you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided
        in the contact section.
        
        ‍
        
    <h3>  The rights of users</h3>
        
        You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the
        following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of
        your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried
        out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us,
        obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing
        processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or
        corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which
        case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain
        circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your
        information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it
        transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is
        processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on
        pre-contractual obligations thereof.
        
        ‍
        
    <h3>  The right to object to processing</h3>
        
        Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us
        or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground
        related to your situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be
        processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any
        justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to
        the relevant sections of this document.

        limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not
        limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In
        the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a

        upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Software Applications and
        Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your
